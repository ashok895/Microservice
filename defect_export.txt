Key: SCRUM-1
Summary: The /projects endpoint does not validate the emp_id parameter properly, leading to potential issues when the parameter is missing or invalid.
Description: The /projects endpoint in employee_projects.py only checks for the presence of the emp_id parameter but does not validate its format or ensure it is a valid employee ID. This can result in unnecessary database queries or errors when invalid data is passed.
